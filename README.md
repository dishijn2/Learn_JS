JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JS has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.


JavaScript Best Practices

~ Avoid global variables, avoid new, avoid ==, avoid eval()

~ It is a good coding practice to initialize variables when you declare them.

~ Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects.

~ If a function is called with a missing argument, the value of the missing argument is set to undefined.

~ Always end your switch statements with a default. Even if you think there is no need for it.


JavaScript Common Mistakes

~ JavaScript programs may generate unexpected results if a programmer accidentally uses an assignment operator (=), instead of a comparison operator (==) in an if statement.

~ It is a default JavaScript behavior to close a statement automatically at the end of a line.

~ JavaScript will close the return statement at the end of the line, because it is a complete statement.



ECMAScript 5 - JavaScript 5

The "use strict" Directive
"use strict" defines that the JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".
With strict mode you can, for example, not use undeclared variables.

String.trim()
String.trim() removes whitespace from both sides of a string.

Array.isArray()
The isArray() method checks whether an object is an array.

Array.forEach()
The forEach() method calls a function once for each array element.
