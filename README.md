JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JS has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.


JavaScript Best Practices

~ Avoid global variables, avoid new, avoid ==, avoid eval()

~ It is a good coding practice to initialize variables when you declare them.

~ Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects.

~ If a function is called with a missing argument, the value of the missing argument is set to undefined.

~ Always end your switch statements with a default. Even if you think there is no need for it.


JavaScript Common Mistakes

~ JavaScript programs may generate unexpected results if a programmer accidentally uses an assignment operator (=), instead of a comparison operator (==) in an if statement.

~ It is a default JavaScript behavior to close a statement automatically at the end of a line.

~ JavaScript will close the return statement at the end of the line, because it is a complete statement.
